# Hackathon Examples

This repository contains Java and TypeScript examples for your hackathon. The examples were written by two engineers who definitely don't know Java or JavaScript/TypeScript. We hope you'll forgive us for some mistakes that we've made.

- [Java Semantic Kernel Search Example][2] (this SDK is *very* new)
- [TypeScript OpenAI examples][3]
- [JavaScript Vector Search examples][4]
- [Azure OpenAI Studio][5]

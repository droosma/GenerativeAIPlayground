# Hackathon Examples

This repository contains Java and TypeScript examples for your hackathon. The examples were written by two engineers who definitely don't know Java or JavaScript/TypeScript. We hope you'll forgive us for some mistakes that we've made.

- [Java OpenAI and AI Search SDK Example][1]
- [Java Semantic Kernel Search Example][2] (this SDK is *very* new)
- [TypeScript OpenAI examples][3]
- [JavaScript Vector Search examples][4]
- [Azure OpenAI Studio][5]

## Retrieval Augmented Generation

Throughout this hackathon, you will come across the term "Retrieval Augmented Generation" (RAG). This is a technique that combines the power of search with the power of language models. The idea is that you can use a search engine to find relevant documents, and then use a language model to generate text based on the documents. This is a powerful technique that can be used for many different tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and more. You can read more about doing RAG with Azure AI Search [here][6]
